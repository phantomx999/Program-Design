#### Windows - Visual Studio 2017 (Experimental)
 * Prerequsites
   * CMake 3.9 or above
   * Visual Studio 2017
   * Git (including git-bash for bash command line)

   ```bash
   # Build the program with BuildWithVS2017.sh
   ./BuildWithVS2017.sh
   # Run the program
   ./build/bin/flashphoto
   ```
   
 * Using Visual Studio
   1. After Building and Running above, there will be a visual studio solution created
      in PROJ/src/flashphoto/build
   2. Open the solution PROJ/src/flashphoto/build/flashphoto.sln
   3. Build the solution.
   4. Set flashphoto as the startup project by right clicking.
   5. Run the program using the green arrow.
