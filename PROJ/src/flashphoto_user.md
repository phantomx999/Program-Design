is the filters component, which allows you to add in a creative, artistic, unique edge
to all your photos that will surely impress your friends, coworkers, clients, and family members.

Let's start out with the layout, which is very simple and visually intuitive.  The tool
section is circled in red, while the filter section is in blue below:

detail below.

##Tools: 
- pen
- calligraphy pen
- chalk 
- highlighter
- spray can
- eraser
- blur tool

##Filters:
- blur 
- motion blur
- sharpen
- edge detect
- threshold

###Tool 1: Pen
This is the most basic tool, which just simply makes a basic pen stroke on the canvas.
It's good for annotation or for simple writing.  Notice that you can increase the size
of the pen stroke, as well as the color of the pen.  In fact, most tools in Flashphoto 
have this ability

###Tool 2: Calligraphy Pen
This pen is exactly as it sounds - a pen good for calligraphy.  If you are interested 
in making calligraphy symbols, or cursive types of writing and drawing, then this
pen is for you!

###Tool 3: Chalk 
The chalk tool gives a chalky, bumpy effect on the canvas.  If you loved to draw with chalk
as a kid, then you'll certainly enjoy this tool.

###Tool 4: Highlighter 
No surprise, but this tool makes a highlighting, stroke motion over the canvas.
Good for highlighting and drawing thick lines.

<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_highlight.png" alt="flashphoto_highlight" height="300" width="500"/>

###Tool 5: Spray Can
The spray can tool looks like a spray can effect on the canvas.  You can move the tool
around to give more of a diffuse spray can effect, you can focus the tool on area of
the canvas to paint more saturation.

###Tool 6: Eraser
Of course, you need an eraser just in case you make a mistake.  The eraser is very
basic and easy to use

<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_eraser.png" alt="flashphoto_eraser" height="300" width="500"/>

###Tool 7: Blur Tool
This tool is great if you want to blur our just a very small section of your image.
Instead of relying on an entire filter to blur our the entire image (see below), you
can use the blur tool to blur out a specific section of the image.

##Filters:

The filters allows you to enhance your images in a whole number of different ways!  For example, 
each filter can alter the shades and colors of the pixels in your image to really make it look special.
  
There are 8 different filters in the Flashphoto application, each with a different artistic style
that make each of them unique.

###Filter 1: Blur Filter
The blur filter can make your image blurry, which is really useful for an image that has a lot of
different colors and textures.  For instance, you might have an image with a lot of lights and shading
that could benefit from blur filter.

<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_blurscreenshot.png" alt="flashphoto_blurscreenshot" height="300" width="500"/>
 
Just click on the "Blur" section under filters and decide the amount you want your image to be blurred out
(the higher the number, the more blurry the image).  Simply click on "Apply" and viola:

<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_blurfilter.png" alt="flashphoto_blurfilter" height="300" width="500"/>

Notice the blur filter when applied makes the image look really cool!

###Filter 2: Motion Blur
Alright, let's say that you still want a blurry image, but you want to make it look like the
camera was moving when taking the image.  Or perhaps you want to create a streaking motion
for a certain particular image.

Well, with motion blur, you can alter the image so that it becomes blurry with a specified direction.
Just click on "Motion Blur" below in filters, specify the amount of how much blur you want, and then specify 
which direction you want to make it look like the camera is moving while taking the picture, then click apply.

<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_motionblurNS.png" alt="flashphoto_motionblurNS" height="300" width="500"/>

As you can see, the image above is blurred out from a North/South direction.  Now let's try a East/West direction.

<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_motionblurEW.png" alt="flashphoto_motionblurEW" height="300" width="500"/>

Notice the difference?  Pretty cool!  You can also do a diagnol Northwest to Southeast, or Northeast to Southwest direction, 
whatever floats your boat!

###Filter 3:  Sharpen
The Sharpen filter really enhances the image to give those colors a vibrant, sharp color contrast that can make 
your image really stand out.  It's a great filter for an image with a lot of colors.

Just click on "Sharpen" in filters, apply the degree of sharpening you want for your image, and then hit "Apply":

<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_sharpen.png" alt="flashphoto_sharpen" height="300" width="500"/>

Notice the image colors are really enhanced!

###Filter 4: Edge Detect
This filter makes only the edges of shapes in your image bright, while the rest of the image is "darkened out."
It is an excellent filter to give a silhouette, shadow effect.

<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_edgedetect.png" alt="flashphoto_edgedetect" height="300" width="500"/>

(There is no amount of how much you want your image to have edge detection, just simply hit "apply" for this one)

###Filter 5: Threshold Filter
This filter gives a great, black and white new image from your original image.  It can also give a 
great silhouette, object contrast between darker and lighter pixels.

Click on "Threshold" under filters and notice the degree of the threshold you wish to use.  A higher number
will create more of a darker threshold shade like the one below.

<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_thresholddark.png" alt="flashphoto_thresholddark" height="300" width="500"/>

If you input a lower numerical input value the filter will apply a more lighter threshold shade onto your image.

<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_thresholdlight.png" alt="flashphoto_thresholdlight" height="300" width="500"/>


###Filter 6: Saturate Filter
The Saturate Filter simply increases or decreases the color of your image.  If you want a darker, grayer image, just
decrease the saturate level under "Saturate" and click Apply.  If you want a very colorful image, increase the color attribute and apply it.

<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_saturate.png" alt="flashphoto_saturation" height="300" width="500"/>

(High saturation number applied) 

###Filter 7: Channels Filter (Adjust R, G, B)
The channels filter adjusts the degree of red, green, and blue color hues in the pixels, which ultimately 
alter your images colors based on your own preference.  For example, you can adjust each red, green, and blue
channel individually and create cool composite color tones when fiddling around with this filter.

Let's first make this filter have more a red shading.  Just go to "Adjust R, G, B" under filters and increase
the red channel number.

<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_red.png" alt="flashphoto_red" height="300" width="500"/>

Or if you prefer the color green, you can increase the green channel value and decrease red.

<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_green.png" alt="flashphoto_green" height="200" width="300"/>

Or if blue is your favorite color, you can increase blue while decreasing read and green to your own 
personal preference.

<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_blue.png" alt="flashphoto_blue" height="200" width="300"/>

Ultimately, you can mix and match different colors with the Channels filter to change the overall 
color of your image.


###Filter 8: Quantize Filter
The Quantize Filter "bins" your red, green, and blue color hues into a different degrees of intensity.  The higher 
the number inputted, the greater amount of bins used, while the lower number inputted results in a lower number of bins
used.  A lower number inputted as shown below results in more of a color change in the image, as there is
more color intensity contrast of red, green, and blue hues in adjacent pixels.

(Once again, click "Quantize", select the number of bins, and click "Apply")

<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_quantize.png" alt="flashphoto_quantize" height="200" width="300"/>

As you can see, Flashphoto is very easy to use and has all the tools and filters you 
need to really make many different unique images!
