===========

Written by Andrew Steinbrueck

Have you ever had an image that looked ok, but you wanted to alter or enhance
it so that it would look way better?  Perhaps you are a struggling artist and 
you want to find a good and simple way to improve your images without much technical
knowledge or effort?

Or perhaps you are an image editor and you just havent found a good and easy to use 
application to fulfill this goal?

Or perhaps you just want to impress your friends and family 
by improving your social media images of yourself at your favorite vacation spot?

Well you are in luck!  Today, you will be introduced to the magical, all amazing, all
encompassing Flashphoto application!  It's easy to learn, easy to use, and easy to 
make that perfect image that you have been looking to create.

Whats so great about it?  Well it has all your basic Paint application tools,
plus a few more cool paint tools such as a blur tool, a spray can tool, a chalk tool, 
and even a calligraphy pen tool.

However, the best part of the Flashphoto application
is the filters component, which allows you to add in a creative, artistic, unique edge
to all your photos that will surely impress your friends, coworkers, clients, and family members.

The filters allows you to enhance your images in a whole number of different ways!  For example, 
each filter can alter the shades and colors of the pixels in your image to really make it look special.
  
There are 8 different filters in the Flashphoto application, each with a different artistic style
that make each of them unique.

Filter 1: Blur Filter
The blur filter can make your image blurry, which is really useful for an image that has a lot of
different colors and textures.  For instance, you might have an image with a lot of lights and shading, 
like this cars driving in the city light shown below:
 
Just click on the "Blur" section under filters and decide the amount you want your image to be blurred out
(the higher the number, the more blurry the image).  Simply click on "Apply" and viola:


Notice the blur filter when applied makes the image look really cool!

Filter 2: Motion Blur
Alright, let's say that you still want a blurry image, but you want to make it look like the
camera was moving when taking the image.  Or perhaps you want to create a streaking motion
for a certain particular image, like the one below:

Well, with motion blur, you can alter the image so that it becomes blurry with a specified direction.
Just click on "Motion Blur" below in filters, specify the amount of how much blur you want, and then specify 
which direction you want to make it look like the camera is moving while taking the picture, then click apply.

As you can see, the image above is blurred out from a North/South direction.  Now let's try a East/West direction.

Notice the difference?  Pretty cool!  You can also do a diagnol Northwest to Southeast, or Northeast to Southwest direction, 
whatever floats your boat!

Filter 3:  Sharpen
The Sharpen filter really enhances the image to give those colors a vibrant, sharp color contrast that can make 
your image really stand out.  It's a great filter for an image with a lot of colors, like the one below:

Just click on "Sharpen" in filters, apply the degree of sharpening you want for your image, and then hit "Apply":

Notice the image colors are really enhanced!

Filter 4: Edge Detect
This filter makes only the edges of shapes in your image bright, while the rest of the image is "darkened out."
It is an excellent filter to give a silhouette, shadow effect.

(There is no amount of how much you want your image to have edge detection, just simply hit "apply" for this one)

Filter 5: Threshold Filter
This filter gives a great, black and white new image from your original image.  It can also give a 
great silhouette, object contrast between darker and lighter pixels.

Click on "Threshold" under filters and notice the degree of the threshold you wish to use.  A lower number
will create more of a darker threshold shade like the one below.

If you input a higher numerical input value the filter will apply a more lighter threshold shade onto your image.


Filter 6: Saturate Filter
The Saturate Filter simply increases or decreases the color of your image.  If you want a darker, grayer image, just
decrease the saturate level under "Saturate" and click Apply.  If you want a very colorful image, increase the color attribute and apply it.

(Low saturation applied)
(High saturation) 

Filter 7: Channels Filter (Adjust R, G, B)
The channels filter adjusts the degree of red, green, and blue color hues in the pixels, which ultimately 
alter your images colors based on your own preference.  For example, you can adjust each red, green, and blue
channel individually and create cool composite color tones when fiddling around with this filter.

Let's first make this filter have more a red shading.  Just go to "Adjust R, G, B" under filters and increase
the red channel number.

Or if you prefer the color green, you can increase the green channel value and decrease red.

Or if blue is your favorite color, you can increase blue while decreasing read and green to your own 
personal preference.

Ultimately, you can mix and match different colors with the Channels filter to change the overall 
color of your image.


Filter 8: Quantize Filter
The Quantize Filter "bins" your red, green, and blue color hues into a different degrees of intensity.  The higher 
the number inputted, the greater amount of bins used, while the lower number inputted results in a lower number of bins
used.  A lower number inputted as shown below results in more of a color change in the image, as there is
more color intensity contrast of red, green, and blue hues in adjacent pixels.

(Once again, click "Quantize", select the number of bins, and click "Apply")
