Here is the basic layout of Mia.  As you can see, it's simple, clean, and easy to read.
The load/save section is circled in green, the tools section is circled in red, and
the filters are circled in blue.

###Load Image:

Let's first load a file, such as a medical image.  Just simply click on load in the top
section of the mia tool bar, find your image you want to load, and click "load."

The image is now loaded and you can choose to do a lot of different types of annotation
with it.  Let's first cover the tools Mia offers.

###Tool 1: Pen
The pen is simple and essential tool to use to annotate your images.  It's great for 
writing doctor's notes especially.  Change the color on the left side
tool bar circled in purple.

###Tool 2: Stamp
The stamp is great for really pointing out a section of a medical image, such as a fractured 
bone for example.  Just click on the area you wish to target and the stamp will be applied

###Filter 1: Blur
You can blur out your image using blur filter if necessary

###Filter 2: Sharpening
The sharpening filter is great if you need a clearer, more precise image to annotate

###Filter 3: Edge Detect
Edge detect allows you to only view the edges of shapes in your image, which
could be another useful tool for annotation.

###Filter 4: Threshold
Threshold filter is great for an image you want to be only black and white, 
which could be great for annotation in certain circumstances.

###Filter 5: Quantize
Quantize is excellent for making color intensities of different objects stand out.

###Saving Image:

Once you finish with applying tools and filters to annotate your image, you can now 
save it for later reference.  Just click on Save in the top toolbar area and choose
whatever directory and file name you wish to save for your image.
