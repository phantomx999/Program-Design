<p>Written by Andrew Steinbrueck</p>
<p>Have you ever had an image that looked ok, but you wanted to alter or enhance it so that it would look way better? Perhaps you are a struggling artist and you want to find a good and simple way to improve your images without much technical knowledge or effort?</p>
<p>Or perhaps you are an image editor and you just havent found a good and easy to use application to fulfill this goal? Or perhaps you just want to impress your friends and family by improving your social media images of yourself at your favorite vacation spot?</p>
<p>Well you are in luck! Today, you will be introduced to the magical, all amazing, all encompassing Flashphoto application! It's easy to learn, easy to use, and easy to make that perfect image that you have been looking to create.</p>
<p>Whats so great about it? Well it has all your basic Paint application tools, plus a few more cool paint tools such as a blur tool, a spray can tool, a chalk tool, and even a calligraphy pen tool. However, the best part of the Flashphoto application is the filters component, which allows you to add in a creative, artistic, unique edge to all your photos that will surely impress your friends, coworkers, clients, and family members.</p>
<p>Let's start out with the layout, which is very simple and visually intuitive. The tool section is circled in red, while the filter section is in blue below:</p>
<div class="image">

</div>
<p>There are a total of 7 tools and 8 filters for Flashphoto. We'll cover them in more detail below.</p>
<h2>Tools:</h2>
<ul>
<li>pen</li>
<li>calligraphy pen</li>
<li>chalk</li>
<li>highlighter</li>
<li>spray can</li>
<li>eraser</li>

</ul>
<h2>Filters:</h2>
<ul>
<li>blur</li>
<li>motion blur</li>
<li>sharpen</li>
<li>edge detect</li>
<li>threshold</li>
<li>saturate</li>
<li>Adjust R,G,B (Channels)</li>
<li>Quantize</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tool 1: Pen</h3>
<p>This is the most basic tool, which just simply makes a basic pen stroke on the canvas. It's good for annotation or for simple writing. Notice that you can increase the size of the pen stroke, as well as the color of the pen. In fact, most tools in Flashphoto have this ability</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_pen.png" alt="flashphoto_pen" height="300" width="500"/>
</div>
<h3>Tool 2: Calligraphy Pen</h3>
<p>This pen is exactly as it sounds - a pen good for calligraphy. If you are interested in making calligraphy symbols, or cursive types of writing and drawing, then this pen is for you!</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_calligraphypen.png" alt="flashphoto_calligraphypen" height="300" width="500"/>
</div>
<h3>Tool 3: Chalk</h3>
<p>The chalk tool gives a chalky, bumpy effect on the canvas. If you loved to draw with chalk as a kid, then you'll certainly enjoy this tool.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_chalk.png" alt="flashphoto_chalk" height="300" width="500"/>
</div>
<h3>Tool 4: Highlighter</h3>
<p>No surprise, but this tool makes a highlighting, stroke motion over the canvas. Good for highlighting and drawing thick lines.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_highlight.png" alt="flashphoto_highlight" height="300" width="500"/>
</div>
<h3>Tool 5: Spray Can</h3>
<p>The spray can tool looks like a spray can effect on the canvas. You can move the tool around to give more of a diffuse spray can effect, you can focus the tool on area of the canvas to paint more saturation.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_spraycan.png" alt="flashphoto_spraycan" height="300" width="500"/>
</div>
<h3>Tool 6: Eraser</h3>
<p>Of course, you need an eraser just in case you make a mistake. The eraser is very basic and easy to use</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_eraser.png" alt="flashphoto_eraser" height="300" width="500"/>
</div>
<h3>Tool 7: Blur Tool</h3>
<p>This tool is great if you want to blur our just a very small section of your image. Instead of relying on an entire filter to blur our the entire image (see below), you can use the blur tool to blur out a specific section of the image.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_blurtool.png" alt="flashphoto_blurtool" height="300" width="500"/>
</div>
<h2>Filters:</h2>
<p>The filters allows you to enhance your images in a whole number of different ways! For example, each filter can alter the shades and colors of the pixels in your image to really make it look special.</p>
<p>There are 8 different filters in the Flashphoto application, each with a different artistic style that make each of them unique.</p>
<h3>Filter 1: Blur Filter</h3>
<p>The blur filter can make your image blurry, which is really useful for an image that has a lot of different colors and textures. For instance, you might have an image with a lot of lights and shading that could benefit from blur filter.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_blurscreenshot.png" alt="flashphoto_blurscreenshot" height="300" width="500"/>
</div>
<p>Just click on the "Blur" section under filters and decide the amount you want your image to be blurred out (the higher the number, the more blurry the image). Simply click on "Apply" and viola:</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_blurfilter.png" alt="flashphoto_blurfilter" height="300" width="500"/>
</div>
<p>Notice the blur filter when applied makes the image look really cool!</p>
<h3>Filter 2: Motion Blur</h3>
<p>Alright, let's say that you still want a blurry image, but you want to make it look like the camera was moving when taking the image. Or perhaps you want to create a streaking motion for a certain particular image.</p>
<p>Well, with motion blur, you can alter the image so that it becomes blurry with a specified direction. Just click on "Motion Blur" below in filters, specify the amount of how much blur you want, and then specify which direction you want to make it look like the camera is moving while taking the picture, then click apply.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_motionblurNS.png" alt="flashphoto_motionblurNS" height="300" width="500"/>
</div>
<p>As you can see, the image above is blurred out from a North/South direction. Now let's try a East/West direction.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_motionblurEW.png" alt="flashphoto_motionblurEW" height="300" width="500"/>
</div>
<p>Notice the difference? Pretty cool! You can also do a diagnol Northwest to Southeast, or Northeast to Southwest direction, whatever floats your boat!</p>
<h3>Filter 3: Sharpen</h3>
<p>The Sharpen filter really enhances the image to give those colors a vibrant, sharp color contrast that can make your image really stand out. It's a great filter for an image with a lot of colors.</p>
<p>Just click on "Sharpen" in filters, apply the degree of sharpening you want for your image, and then hit "Apply":</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_sharpen.png" alt="flashphoto_sharpen" height="300" width="500"/>
</div>
<p>Notice the image colors are really enhanced!</p>
<h3>Filter 4: Edge Detect</h3>
<p>This filter makes only the edges of shapes in your image bright, while the rest of the image is "darkened out." It is an excellent filter to give a silhouette, shadow effect.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_edgedetect.png" alt="flashphoto_edgedetect" height="300" width="500"/>
</div>
<p>(There is no amount of how much you want your image to have edge detection, just simply hit "apply" for this one)</p>
<h3>Filter 5: Threshold Filter</h3>
<p>This filter gives a great, black and white new image from your original image. It can also give a great silhouette, object contrast between darker and lighter pixels.</p>
<p>Click on "Threshold" under filters and notice the degree of the threshold you wish to use. A higher number will create more of a darker threshold shade like the one below.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_thresholddark.png" alt="flashphoto_thresholddark" height="300" width="500"/>
</div>
<p>If you input a lower numerical input value the filter will apply a more lighter threshold shade onto your image.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_thresholdlight.png" alt="flashphoto_thresholdlight" height="300" width="500"/>
</div>
<h3>Filter 6: Saturate Filter</h3>
<p>The Saturate Filter simply increases or decreases the color of your image. If you want a darker, grayer image, just decrease the saturate level under "Saturate" and click Apply. If you want a very colorful image, increase the color attribute and apply it.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_saturate.png" alt="flashphoto_saturation" height="300" width="500"/>
</div>
<p>(High saturation number applied)</p>
<h3>Filter 7: Channels Filter (Adjust R, G, B)</h3>
<p>The channels filter adjusts the degree of red, green, and blue color hues in the pixels, which ultimately alter your images colors based on your own preference. For example, you can adjust each red, green, and blue channel individually and create cool composite color tones when fiddling around with this filter.</p>
<p>Let's first make this filter have more a red shading. Just go to "Adjust R, G, B" under filters and increase the red channel number.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_red.png" alt="flashphoto_red" height="300" width="500"/>
</div>
<p>Or if you prefer the color green, you can increase the green channel value and decrease red.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_green.png" alt="flashphoto_green" height="200" width="300"/>
</div>
<p>Or if blue is your favorite color, you can increase blue while decreasing read and green to your own personal preference.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_blue.png" alt="flashphoto_blue" height="200" width="300"/>
</div>
<p>Ultimately, you can mix and match different colors with the Channels filter to change the overall color of your image.</p>
<h3>Filter 8: Quantize Filter</h3>
<p>The Quantize Filter "bins" your red, green, and blue color hues into a different degrees of intensity. The higher the number inputted, the greater amount of bins used, while the lower number inputted results in a lower number of bins used. A lower number inputted as shown below results in more of a color change in the image, as there is more color intensity contrast of red, green, and blue hues in adjacent pixels.</p>
<p>(Once again, click "Quantize", select the number of bins, and click "Apply")</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../../screenshots/flashphoto_quantize.png" alt="flashphoto_quantize" height="200" width="300"/>
</div>
<p>As you can see, Flashphoto is very easy to use and has all the tools and filters you need to really make many different unique images! </p>
